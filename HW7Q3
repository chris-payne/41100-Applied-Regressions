# i Examine the data for outlier patterns in the weather and remove them. 
##  Give clear justification for each data point removed.

setwd(dir = '/Users/ChrisMacAir/Documents/Chicago Booth/2019Q2/Regressions/WK9')
BikeData = read.csv(file = "bikeSharing.csv")

# ii First split the data into training and testing samples (size and sampling scheme is up to you).
# ii We wonâ€™t use the test set until the very end.

BikeData$logTotal <- log(BikeData$count)
### you need to get rid of the "label" column, and ViolentCR Does this apply to our data??
### Time seems to matter. Do I want to get rid of count like we got rid of violent CR??
XY <- BikeData[,-(10:12)] 
## create training and validation sets
index <- sample(1:nrow(BikeData),1000)
training <- XY[index,] 
validation <- XY[-index,]

## define the scope from small model to big
null <- lm(logTotal ~ 1, data=training)
full <- lm(logTotal ~ ., data=training)
## build a regression model with the BIC
fwdBIC <- step(null, scope=formula(full), direction="forward", k=log(1000))
### why is this messing up? Followed example exactly...

# iii Create dummy variables for each hour (24 total).
